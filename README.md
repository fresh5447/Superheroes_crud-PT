It's nice to update our .gitignore before our first commit..


had to run npm init to make a package.json => every node proj has one of these

had to install express so we can use it as our dev server

created the server on port 3000

create an endpoint /test to handle a GET request..


We defined a mongoose schema in the file models/superhero

A schema is like a blueprint, it defines what all future heroes will look
like. It will be a constructor function we will use to actually make new
superheroes.
